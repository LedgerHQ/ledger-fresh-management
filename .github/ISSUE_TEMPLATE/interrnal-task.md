Welcome! 
This template is designed for outlining tasks that are not open for contributions. It is divided into two sections: the header and the body.
- The header section serves as the ID card for the task, displaying the task name, the module it belongs to, its difficulty level, and its dependency.
- The body section includes a brief overview, a detailed description, and supplementary resources.

As the issue author, it is your responsibility to complete the header and body sections of this template. Once you have written your content, please don't forget to include some additional metadata at the end: 
- the relevant tags, at least the tag of the module. If it doesn't exist yet, feel free to create it
- linking the issue to the project the issue belongs to. Projects are used to group issues by module in a single table. If you need to create an issue for a module that doesn't yet have one, you can do so by visiting https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-fresh-management/projects?query=is%3Aopen.

In addition to that, please use the following format for the title: [<MODULE>] - <TITLE>.

The phrases surrounded by <!-- -- > are comments left to guide you in writing your issue, they will not appear in the final version of the document. Feel free to contribute to the file in order to improve it.

Please keep in mind that this is the initial post in this thread on the issue at hand. You are welcome to regularly update it with additional information that will be helpful to readers and to make additional posts to continue the conversation. Consider this thread as a forum and use it to its full potential.

At later point, if you want to convert this issue into a bounty, you can do so by following the instructions in the "External contributions" section.
