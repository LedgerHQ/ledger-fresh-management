Welcome! 
This template is designed for outlining tasks that are open for contributions. It is divided into three sections: the header, body, and external contribution section.
- The header section serves as the ID card for the task, displaying the task name, the module it belongs to, its difficulty level, and its dependency.
- The body section includes a brief overview, a detailed description, and supplementary resources.
- The final section includes all information regarding external grants. In this section, readers can find the link to the bounty and the prize. This section is not required to create the task, you can skip it for now then edit the original message in the created issue to complete it later.

As the issue author, it is your responsibility to complete the header and body sections of this template. Once you have written your content, please don't forget to include some additional metadata at the end: 
- the relevant tags, at least the tag of the module. If it doesn't exist yet, feel free to create it
- linking the issue to the project the issue belongs to. Projects are used to group issues by module in a single table. If you need to create an issue for a module that doesn't yet have one, you can do so by visiting https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-fresh-management/projects?query=is%3Aopen.

In addition to that, please use the following format for the title: [<MODULE>] - <TITLE> and don't remove the "open for contribution" tag automatically added to the issue. This will help us to keep track of the issues that are open for contributions.

The phrases surrounded by <!-- -- > are comments left to guide you in writing your issue, they will not appear in the final version of the document. Feel free to contribute to the file in order to improve it.

As the last section is optional, it is surrounded by the comments characters to hide it by default. If you complete this section, remember to remove the comments characters.

Please keep in mind that this is the initial post in this thread on the issue at hand. You are welcome to regularly update it with additional information that will be helpful to readers and to make additional posts to continue the conversation. Consider this thread as a forum and use it to its full potential.
